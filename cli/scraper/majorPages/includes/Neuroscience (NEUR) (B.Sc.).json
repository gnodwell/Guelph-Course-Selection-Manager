[{"title":"Major (Honours Program)","desc":["This Honours program provides a foundation in the natural sciences and an opportunity to develop advanced knowledge of nervous system structure and function, and the skills required for independent inquiry within neuroscience. The specialization is unique in its emphasis on integrative/interdisciplinary problem solving. Through the use of electives, students may structure a program that emphasizes molecular and biomedical neuroscience, behavioural and cognitive neuroscience, or comparative neuroscience.","The major prepares students for professional programs in health science (medical, physiotherapy, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, nursing), post-graduate degrees in neuroscience research, and provides a strong foundation for students wishing to pursue careers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, public health, teaching, and scientific publishing & journalism.","Students may enter this major in Semester 1 or any semester thereafter. A student wishing to declare the major may wish to consult with a Faculty Advisor. A minimum total of 20.00 credits is required to complete the major.","Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology, Chemistry or Physics should follow the revised schedule of study for this major found at: https://www.uoguelph.ca/bsc/revised_SS"],"table":[{"courses":["BIOL*1080","CHEM*1040","MATH*1080","PHYS*1080","BIOL*1070","BIOL*1090","CHEM*1050","PHYS*1070","PSYC*1000","BIOC*2580","MBG*2040","NEUR*2000","STAT*2040 or PSYC*1010","MCB*2050","PHYS*2030","PSYC*3410","BIOM*3000","NEUR*3100","PSYC*3270","BIOM*3090","NEUR*3500","NEUR*4000","NEUR*4100"],"credits":8}],"lists":[],"footnotes":[]},{"title":"Restricted Electives","desc":["Students are advised to pay particular attention to pre-requisite requirements when choosing individual courses, and seek advice as needed."],"table":[],"lists":[],"footnotes":[["Indicates courses that require additional prerequisites.","Note: If HK*2810 Human Physiology I - Concepts and  Principles is completed in Semester 4, HK*3810 Human Physiology II - Integrated Systems must be completed in Semester 5 in order to meet the BIOM*3090 Principles of Pharmacology pre-requisite requirement"]]},{"title":"Lists of Recommended Electives","desc":["The following lists contain recommended electives for students wishing to emphasize particular areas in neuroscience."],"table":[{"courses":["Psychology","PSYC*2330","PSYC*2390","PSYC*2650","PSYC*3030","PSYC*3100","PSYC*3330","PSYC*3410","PSYC*4470","PSYC*4570","Computation, Modeling and Statistics","CIS*1300","CIS*2500","MATH*1090","MATH*1160","MATH*2270","MATH*3510","PSYC*3250","PSYC*3290","STAT*3240","Biological Science","BIOC*3560","BIOC*4580","BIOM*4070","MBG*3050","MCB*3010","MCB*4010","ZOO*3000","Health & Disease","BIOM*3040","BIOM*4030","BIOM*4050","HK*3100","HK*3810","HK*4070","TOX*4000","Research Based","For students who are interested in graduate studies, a research course is recommended","BIOM*4500","BIOM*4510","BIOM*4521","BIOM*4522","HK*4230","HK*4360","HK*4371","HK*4372","IBIO*4500","IBIO*4510","IBIO*4521","IBIO*4522","MCB*4500","MCB*4510","MCB*4600","NEUR*4401","NEUR*4402","NEUR*4450","PSYC*3240","PSYC*4240","PSYC*4870","PSYC*4880"],"credits":0}],"lists":[],"footnotes":[["Indicates courses that require additional prerequisites.","Faculty advisor will determine if this course is an eligible science elective, depending on the instructor and topic"]]},{"title":"Credit Summary","desc":["(20.00 Total Credits)","Of the 20 total credits required, students must complete 16.00 credits in science of which a minimum of 2.00 credits must be at the 4000 level and an additional 4.00 credits must be at the 3000 or 4000 level."],"table":[{"courses":["First year science core","Required science courses semester 3-8","Restricted elective (#1,2,3,4 in restricted electives list)","Approved Science Elective 1","Required Liberal Education Elective 2","Liberal Education Electives","Free Electives","Total Credits"],"credits":0}],"lists":[],"footnotes":[["3.00 Approved Science Electives if a PHIL*XXXX course is selected for restricted electives #1","PSYC*1000 Introduction to Psychology"]]},{"title":"Minor (Honours Program)","desc":["A minor in Neuroscience requires a minimum of 5.00 credits including:","Please note that some of the restricted electives require prerequisites that are not included in the minor."],"table":[{"courses":["BIOL*1090","PSYC*1000","PSYC*2330","NEUR*2000 or PSYC*2410","PSYC*1010 or STAT*2040","Select a minimum of 0.50 credits from the following:","BIOM*2000","BIOM*3200","HK*2810","ZOO*3600","Select a minimum of 2.00 credits from the following:","BIOM*3000","BIOM*3090","BIOM*4030","HK*3100","MBG*2040","MBG*3050","MCB*2050","NEUR*3100","NEUR*4000","NEUR*4100","PHYS*2030","PHYS*2330","PSYC*2390","PSYC*2650","PSYC*3030","PSYC*3270","PSYC*3330","PSYC*3410","PSYC*4750","Of the 2.00 additional credits, students may select one course from the following:","BIOM*3040","MBG*4040","ZOO*3050"],"credits":0}],"lists":[],"footnotes":[]}]
