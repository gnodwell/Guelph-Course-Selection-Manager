# W22_CIS3760_Team4 - Sprint 1

<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
## About 

Sprint 1 required us to create a web scraper using PlayWright (https://playwright.dev/) and either Node.JS or Python. 
It then required us to create a CLI (command line interface) to search and view the data provided by the scraper.

The webscraper we created scrapes data from the University of Guelph course descriptions website (https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/course-descriptions/)
and saves the data of all courses at UofG into a JSON file. The data is in the format: course code, course name, course description, semesters offered, lecture times, 
restrictions, offerings, credit weight, department, location, prerequesites and equates.
